Your task is to build a simple stateless microservice in Node Js, with four  major functionalities -
Authentication
JSON patching
Image Thumbnail Generation
Adding User address in database
We have no requirements for which frameworks/libraries/database to use, choose whichever seems best suited for the task! 
Required Endpoints
The API should feature the following endpoint functionality -
Public Endpoints
Login Request body should contain an arbitrary username/password pair. Treat it as a mock authentication service and accept any username/password. Return a signed Json Web Token(JWT, https://jwt.io/) which can be used to validate future requests.
Protected Endpoints
The following two endpoints should be protected. The JWT obtained in the “Login” endpoint must be attached to each request. If the JWT is missing or invalid, these endpoints should reject the request.
Apply Json Patch Request body should contain a JSON object and a JSON patch object (http://jsonpatch.com/). Apply the json patch to the json object, and return the resulting json object.
Create Thumbnail Request should contain a public image URL. Download the image, resize to 50x50 pixels, and return the resulting thumbnail.
Create a Request to add a user address  and save into the database.
